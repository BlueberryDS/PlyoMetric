# PlyoMetric
Our app puts the metrics in plyometrics by making it effortless to measure, record and improve key indicators of explosive strength 
such as acceleration, vertical leap and air time. The next generation of lightning-quick running-backs and high-flying dunkers will 
never have to use a tape measure to find how high they jump. Users will learn the perfect fundamental movements of jumping, will know 
exactly how much force their knees withstand -- and when exactly to take a day off to recover.

By analyzing every minute aspect of the perfect jump using cutting-edge algorithms, we were able to craft an intelligent application 
that blows off sensor noise like a ground type Pokemon blows off Thunderbolt, identifies proper jumping form better than you can, 
and is so simple your grandmother will be dunking in two weeks*.
